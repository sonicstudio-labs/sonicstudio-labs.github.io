  <p>
    Your privacy is important to us. This chrome extension, Tab Saver, is designed to enhance your browsing experience
    by allowing you to save and restore open browser tabs. Below is how we handle the data collected during this
    process:
  </p>

  <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
  <p>
    The extension saves the URLs and titles of your currently opened browser tabs upon your request. This data is only
    stored locally on your device or in Chrome’s sync storage (if enabled) to provide the tab-saving and restoration
    functionality. We do not collect any additional data beyond this.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Purpose of Data Collection</h3>
  <p>
    The tab data is collected solely for the purpose of saving and restoring browser sessions, allowing you to reopen
    saved tab groups at a later time. This data is not used for tracking, advertising, or any other purposes.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Data Sharing</h3>
  <p>
    We do not share your tab data with any third-party services or external entities. The data remains private to you
    and is stored either locally or synchronized through Chrome’s storage service.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Data Storage and Retention</h3>
  <p>
    The tab data is stored until you choose to delete it by clearing saved tab groups through the extension’s interface
    or by uninstalling the extension.
  </p>

  <h3>5. User Consent</h3>
  <p>
    By using this extension, you agree to allow it to access and store tab data as described. You can revoke this access
    at any time by uninstalling the extension or clearing your saved tab data.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Security</h3>
  <p>
    Your tab data is stored securely in Chrome’s storage system, which includes encryption for synced data. We take
    steps to ensure that your data is not accessed by unauthorized users.
  </p>

  <h3>7. User Rights</h3>
  <p>
    Since all tab data is stored locally on your device or synced through Chrome’s storage system, we do not collect or
    store any of this data on external servers. You can manage and delete your saved tab data at any time through the
    extension interface or by clearing Chrome’s local storage.
